## Overview

You are investigating how the transcription factor MAGIC regulates the expression of two genes WAND and POOF. You use wild-type and mutant lines with different forms of the MAGIC gene and examine the expression of MAGIC, WAND, and POOF. The experiment is a time-course after you add an activator of MAGIC. You collect 4 time points (0, 12, 24, 48 hour) with three biological replicates.

The cells have three mutant forms of MAGIC:

+ a hypomorphic allele (`MAGIC-hypo`) that is known to reduce its activity
+ an siRNA-mediated knockdown of MAGIC (`MAGIC-siRNA`)
+ a deletion of the MAGIC gene (`MAGIC-null`)

You collect expression data in a qPCR experiment in a 384-well plate (a common format for these experiments). The data in CSV format are available in the class package. One CSV contains expression levels and the other contains sample names coded as `cell_time_gene_rt_rep`.

This code will give you the path and file names of the CSVs.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(eda)
```

```{r csv_files}
devtools::install_github('rnabioco/eda')
qpcr384_data_csv <- system.file("extdata", "qpcr-data-384.csv", package = 'eda')
qpcr384_names_csv <- system.file("extdata", "qpcr-names-384.csv", package = 'eda')
```

## Assignment

### Exercise 1

Use a function from the [`readr`](http://readr.tidyverse.org/) library--part of the tidyverse--to load the CSV data. You should have two new tibbles.

```{r answer_1}
qpcr384_data <- read.csv(qpcr384_data_csv)
qpcr384_names <- read.csv(qpcr384_names_csv)
head(qpcr384_names)
qpcr384_names_fixed <- qpcr384_names %>% rename(row=?..row)
head(qpcr384_names_fixed)
head(qpcr384_data)
```

### Exercise 2

Inspect these tibbles and make note of their resemblance to a 384 plate. Tidy these tibbles into this format:

```
# A tibble: 128 x 6
         cell  time  gene    rt   exp_mean      exp_var
        <chr> <chr> <chr> <chr>      <dbl>        <dbl>
 1 MAGIC-hypo     0 ACTIN     -   1.000000 0.000000e+00
 2 MAGIC-hypo     0 ACTIN     +   2.333333 4.133333e-01
 3 MAGIC-hypo     0 MAGIC     -   1.000000 0.000000e+00
 4 MAGIC-hypo     0 MAGIC     +  13.000000 9.750000e+00
 5 MAGIC-hypo     0  POOF     -   1.000000 0.000000e+00
 6 MAGIC-hypo     0  POOF     + 981.333333 5.717973e+05
 7 MAGIC-hypo     0  WAND     -   1.000000 0.000000e+00
 8 MAGIC-hypo     0  WAND     +   1.000000 1.900000e-01
 9 MAGIC-hypo    12 ACTIN     -   1.000000 0.000000e+00
10 MAGIC-hypo    12 ACTIN     +  10.000000 1.600000e-01
# ... with 118 more rows
```

Note that this table does not have `row` and `col` (they have been dropped) and that the replicates have been grouped and summarized by their mean (`exp_mean`) and variance (`exp_var`).

```{r answer_2}
qpcr_data_tidy <- qpcr384_data %>% gather(col, value, -row)
qpcr_data_tidy

qpcr_names_tidy <- qpcr384_names_fixed %>% gather(col, value, -row) %>% separate(value, into=c('cell', 'time', 'gene', 'rt', 'rep'), sep='_')
qpcr_names_tidy

qpcr_tidy <- left_join((qpcr_names_tidy, qpcr_data_tidy))
qpcr_tidy
                    


```

### Exercise 3

You did two sets of qPCR reactions: one where reverse transcriptase was added to your RNA sample, and one where it was not. The `rt` variable reflects this by noting samples with `+` and `-`.

Make two plots of the distribution of expression values for all sample values. In one plot, use `geom_histogram()` and facet by `rt`. In the other plot, change the x-axis scale using `scale_x_log10()`.

What do these plots tell you about the values from the `rt == "-"` samples?

```{r answer_3}
```

### Exercise 4

Create a plot of expression by time for each of the MAGIC cell types. At this point you can remove the `rt == "-"` controls. You will need to plot expression value on a log-scale to see differences.

+ In which cell lines is the expression of `WAND` affected? In what way? Can you make a statement about this (e.g., XXX is required for YYY expression)?

+ Compare the data per-`cell` and per-`gene` by creating two separate plots by grouping (e.g., using facets) one or the other of those variables. Which of these is more useful to see differences in gene expression?

```{r answer_4}
```

### Exercise 5

Normalize the expression data dividing each of the MAGIC, WAND and POOF value by the ACTIN values. You will need to use `spread()` to rearrange the data for calculation, and then `gather()` to reformat for plotting. Re-create the plots from question 4 with this normalized data. Did your interpretation change?

```{r answer_5}
```
